===================================
Map Pack: Portal: the Flash Version
===================================

A map pack for `Mari0`_, inspired by the puzzles in the
`Portal: the Flash Version`_ Flash game.

Where possible, levels in the pack match the levels in the Flash game. Where
this is not possible, the solutions match. Where *that* is not possible...
I dunno.

There are some notable differences in the games, and their impacts on level
design:

1. Mario jumps much higher than the test subject in the Flash game. Test
   Chambers that depend on the jump height of the test subject had to be
   compressed and changes made to prevent Mario from jumping past them.
2. Mario jumps much farther that the test subject. Notably, the pit width
   needed to prevent Mario from jumping across the test chamber results in
   the rest of the chamber being off screen. These are ignored, the fall
   hazard is superficial, the real danger will be lasers or light bridges
   preventing the jump from succeeding.
3. The following structures do not exist, e.g.: glass tubes, spiked crushers,
   moving platforms. These must be replaced by structures with similar
   solution spaces, documented below.

Substitutions
-------------

Glass Tubes
===========

A simple tunnel through which a portal shot can pass, but not the character.

Unfortunately, Mario can pass through one block high tunnels, and no blocks currently allow portal shots to pass, but not Mario. Instead, block the tunnel with a light bridge.

Spike Crushers
==============

A moving platform with spikes affixed.

Simply doesn't exist in Mari0. Current solution is a bank of lasers attached
to a timer.

Moving Platforms
================

A moving platform which supports portals.

Simply doesn't exist in Mari0. Current solution is to place portal-supporting surfaces in the final platform position.
