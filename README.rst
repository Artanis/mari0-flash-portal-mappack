Map Pack: Portal: the Flash Version
===================================

Inspired by the puzzles in the `Portal: the Flash Version`_.

Where possible, levels in the pack match the levels in the Flash game. Where
this is not possible, the solutions match. Where *that* is not possible...
I dunno.

There are some notable differences in the games, and their impacts on level
design:

1. Mario jumps much higher than the test subject in the Flash game. Test
   Chambers that depend on the jump height of the test subject had to be
   compressed and changes made to prevent Mario from jumping past them.
2. Mario jumps much farther that the test subject. Notably, the pit width
   needed to prevent Mario from jumping across the test chamber results in
   the rest of the chamber being off screen. These are ignored, the fall
   hazard is superficial, the real danger will be lasers or light bridges.
